# Random_color_combinations
What makes people like a color combination? (In Progress...)

This is a data science/web development project in Flask, using
javascript, HTML, and CSS. When the web page is loaded, a combination
of two colors is randomly selected and displayed. The user
rates this combination of colors, and the rating is stored
in a database. The idea is that after a large number
of people have given their ratings, a large enough database
of color combinations, their respective ratings, and perhaps
some information about the rater (location, etc.) will be compiled.
Once enough data is available, we can correlate the characteristics of
the relationships between the rgb values of the two colors with the
rating of the color combinations, to discover what makes people find
a color combination pleasing to look at.
